In this project, we first construct the model of the inverted pendulum system. After apply the numerical values, we calculate the eigenvalues associated to the linear state space representation. Because the system is controllable, we are able to use a static state feed back to stabilize the pendulum and the cart around an equilibrium point. By creating Simulink blocks and send the variables to the workspace, we plot the state and  the control. After that, we check if the system is observable. We use two different pole placements to compute K, in order to construct the observer. Because in some cases, we cannot have the access to the actual state, we need to estimate the state from the input and output, which requires the system to be observable. We analyze different plots in the previous sections. In the end, we use our observer and state feedback to create an animation. By these steps, we are able to control the pendulum on a cart. The code is implemented in Matlab 2021b.
